objective: mutate and sumerize data from the UCI HAR dataset

The dataset consists of activities types in activity_labels.txt
                        sensor reading labels  in  features.txt
                        sensor readings for 2 divitions of subjects ie.(train and test)
                        activity type ref numbers in  y_test.txt and y_train.txt
                        subject  ref numbers in X_test.txt and X_train.txt

import steps:
1. download raw text files to local dir "./data"

2. tableize subject_train.txt to 'train_tb' , subject_test to test_tb.
    these are unlabeled vectors of 561 variables.

3. read in features.txt as a char vector. these are the column headers for "train_tb" and "test_tb"

4. insert the headers 

5. the activity and subject numbers corraponding to each row of these tables are in seperate text files which could be tabelized and linked by row number later. I elected to add them directly to train_tb and test_tb in new columns 'subject' and 'activity'

6. for this project we are using only the columns for the mean and standard diviation for these 17 feature categorys (from features_info.txt):
time domain-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
      tBodyAcc-XYZ      ==  tBodyAcc-mean()[-x-y-z] and tBodyAcc-std()[-X-y-z]
      tGravityAcc-XYZ   ==  tGravityAcc-mean()[-x-y-z] and tGravityAcc-std()[-x-y-z] 
      tBodyAccJerk-XYZ  ==  tBodyAccJerk-mean()[-x-y-z] and tBodyAcc-std()[-x-y-z]
      tBodyGyro-XYZ     ==  tBodyGyro-mean()[-x-y-z] and tBodyGyro-std()[-x-y-z]
      tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ ==  tBodyGyroJerk-mean()[-x-y-z] and tBodyGyroJerk-mean()[-x-y-z]
      
      tBodyAccMag       ==  tBodyAccMag-mean() and tBodyAccMag-std()
      tGravityAccMag    ==  tGravityAccMag-mean() and tBodyAccJerkMag-std()
      tBodyAccJerkMag   ==  tBodyAccJerkMag-mean()  and tBodyAccJerkMag-std()
      tBodyGyroMag      ==  tBodyGyroMag-mean() and tBodyGyroMag-std()
      tBodyGyroJerkMag  ==  tBodyGyroJerkMag-mean() and tBodyGyroJerkMag-std()
frequency domain  -----------------------------------------------------------------------    
      fBodyAcc-XYZ      == same as time domain with an f
      fBodyAccJerk-XYZ  == same as time domain with an f 
      fBodyGyro-XYZ     == same as time domain with an f
      
      fBodyAccMag       ==  same as time domain with an f
      fBodyAccJerkMag   ==  same as time domain with an f
      fBodyGyroMag      ==  same as time domain with an f
      fBodyGyroJerkMag  == same as time domain with an f

This should result in a table of 66 columns for feature cols + activity(1) + subject(1)
each row is the selected features derived form the 128 samples per window 
7. arrange rows by activity and subject
8. build a new table with avg of each featue per group
  The returned dataframe has the following columns:
columnname    type      explaination
  "subject"   numeric   index to a subject
  "activity"  char      the activity label
  "feature"   char      The featue label with punctuation characters removed 
  "mean"      numeric   mean of the readings for this feature
